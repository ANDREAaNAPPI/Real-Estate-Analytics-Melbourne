# Real-Estate-Analytics-Melbourne
I performed an in-depth analysis of the Melbourne real estate market on a copyright-free dataset. I performed the analysis as if it had been commissioned by a real estate agency, working on both the code and a technical report.


Here you can find:
- [My Python Code](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/Real-Estate-Analytics-Melbourne/blob/main/Real_Estate_Melbourne.ipynb)
  This is the whole data pipeline (almost whole; some procedures were not even worth including to keep the elaborate clean)
- [My PDF Report](https://github.com/ANDREAaNAPPI/Real-Estate-Analytics-Melbourne/blob/main/Real%20Estate%20Melbourne%20data%20analysis%20Report.pdf)
  The report was performed as if it had been the final product for a real estate business, so I tried to present the insights and explain them in a non-technical language, including only meaningful insights, and 
  without mentioning unnecessary technical details.
